    <p>It is a long<blockquote>established fact that a reader will be distracted</blockquote>  by the readable 
        ontent of a<q>page when looking at its </q> layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is 
        that it has a more-or-less <abbr>normal distribution</abbr> of letters, as opposed to using '
        Content here, content here', making it<address>look like readable </address> English. Many desktop 
        publishing packages and web page editors <cite>now use Lorem Ipsum </cite>as their default model 
        text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will <bdo>many web sites</bdo>uncover  still in their 
        infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
